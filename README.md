# KnightsTravails

This is a Ruby implementation of finding the shortest path for a chess knight from a starting square to a destination square on an 8x8 chessboard, it is based on the KnightsTravails project from theodinproject.com

## Usage

To find the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard, call the find_shortest_path method with the starting square position and destination square position as parameters.
Example usage:

```ruby
find_shortest_path([0,0],[7,7])
```

This will output the shortest path and the number of moves it took for the knight to reach the destination square.
